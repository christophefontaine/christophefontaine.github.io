Me ?
===

Nothing much to say: I worked for 8 years on hardware / software integration, bottom up firmwares and drivers -- sometime even doing very low level electronic debuging -- up to the final realtime and embedded application and the server side of the project.  
I wanted to learn a new technical domain, that's when I joined [Qosmos][Qosmos] (now part of [Enea][Enea]) to work on upstream NFV related projects.  
And that's fun, while the technology are the same, the way of doing things are exactly the opposite: no more interrupts and small/shared resources, happy polling with dedicated resources !  
Since 2018, I joined the NFV Integration group in Red Hat.

I have 3 cats.

Even if I'm more a consumer than a producer on Twitter, you can follow me [here][twitter]!  
All repos I forked from github [christophefontaine][github], and if you'd like to see my full work history, this is on [linkedin][linkedin]
